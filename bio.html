                            Six60 was formed in Dunedin; the founding members met while attending University of Otago. The band created their name from the street number of the house they lived at in Dunedin, 660 Castle Street.[6] As Ji Fraser said, "That's where it all began. It was the beginning of everything. It was a place that meant so much to us."
                        Their local following developed from Dunedin to other student hubs around the country such as Auckland, Waikato, Christchurch and Wellington.
                        Six60's original EP, released in 2009, contained a track called "Someone to Be Around".[8] This track was left off their debut album but remains one of their most popular songs.
                        Six60 have a quadruple platinum number-one debut album with triple platinum-selling single "Don't Forget Your Roots", two double platinum-selling singles "Only to Be" and "Rise Up", two platinum-selling singles "Forever" and "Special", and one gold-selling single "Lost"
                        In early March 2013 the band was featured on George FM Breakfast's 'Damn! I Wish I Was Your Cover' series covering Rudimental's "Feel the Love".
                        In 2014, their song "Run for It" was featured on the trailer of ITV drama series Prey, starring John Simm.[9][10]
